# MetaphoriuminomiconRefresher
A process for refreshing Metaphoriuminomicon from wiki.SolSeed.org

Metaphoriuminomicon.org (target) is more or less a copy of wiki.SolSeed.org (source) but reorganized and static.  Edits in the source website should be copied into the target website but into its structure which is different from the source.  In the source, there is a page called Metaphoriuminomicon which is not the main page.  In the target, the Metaphoriuminomicon is the main page.  In the target the wrap of all pages is changed to reflect the dominance of the Metaphoriuminomicon page.  All files and content from the source are copied into the target and all links in the content are repointed at the copies of the resources in the target website.

Not all of this has been achieved yet.
1) The target does not yet have the image files from the source
2) The new wrap has not been completed or applied to all pages in the target.
3) Not all links have been changed to point at the resources in the target site.

The code which performs the changes are written in a stupid tool that just happened to be easy to achieve a minimum viable product in.  We probably need to port that code to a more scalable and reliale tool but that will probably involve shaving a large number of Yaks.  (put link to image of feild full of bald Yaks here.  LOL)
